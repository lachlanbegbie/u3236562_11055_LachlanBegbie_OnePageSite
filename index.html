                            As life expectancy increases, the number of people exceeding working age will increase,
                            meaning proportionally less workers - both in aiding the development of the economy and
                            the caring for these retirees. This will place increasing pressure on economic growth and
                            consequently the rising standards of living. The ageing population will also result in 
                            fiscal pressures because of the demand for government services.

                            The number of people in the population aged 85 and over is expected to more than quadruple 
                            over the next 40 years. This group has the greatest need for formal aged care. Australian 
                            Government spending on aged care is projected to increase as a proportion of GDP from 0.8 per 
                            cent in 2009-10 to around 1.8 per cent in 2049-50. Over the next four years the Government 
                            will provide more than $44 billion in direct financial support for aged and community care.

                            this will require extensive forward-planning and investment into strained areas.

                            Ageing populations mean the GDP per capita will grow at a lesser rate. It is projected that
                            GDP per capita will grow at a rate of 1.5% per annum over the next 40 years, compared to the
                            growth rate of 1.9% per annum from the last 40 years. Economic growth rate is also expected 
                            to decrease from the 3.3% over the last 40 years to 2.7% in the next 40.

                            The "labour force participation rate", which is the percentage of the population of employable 
                            age, is expected to fall from today's 65%, to 61% by 2050. As a result of this, an increase in 
                            productivity will need to be a driving force behing the future economic growth. Australia's 
                            productivity is currently growing at the 30-year average rate of 1.6% per year, however this 
                            rate will have to increase to ease the economic stresses which can be caused by an ageing 
                            population.

                        <p>
                            There is a projected rise in spending on areas like health, pensions and aged care, all due to 
                            the nature of an ageing population. Most of these increased costs will be a result of new 
                            technologies like medicines, and a continuing demand for better provisions in health services. 
                            These demands will add pressure on the government's budget. Meanwhile, the slower economic growth 
                            will mean Australia will struggle to meet these new spending costs. Many other factors are 
                            contributing to the projected spendings increases, however health costs are estimated to contribute 
                            to around two thirds of this. By 2050, spending is expected to exceed revenue by approximately 2.5% 
                            of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product).

                            We have seen the beginning of the steps taken by the Australian Government in ensuring sustainable

                            Whenever the economy shows signs of strong growth, the government aims to limit the spending growth 
                            to allow the budget grow to an excess. This strategy will over time lead to the country's spending 
                            dropping by percentages of the GDP, placing it significantly on the road to reducing the long-term 
                            pressures on spending.

                            Climate change is the defining intergenerational issue of our time. As Australia is so hot and 
                            dry, it will likely be one of the countries hit hardest by the effects of climate change, and 
                            these effects have a detrimental impact on our environment and economy.

                            The Australian Government has made significant moves towards policies which will encourage people to 
                            engage with the research and development, as well as the use of renewable technologies. The government's 
                            renewable energy target is one where 20% of electricity supply in Australia comes from renewable sources.

                        <p>
                            The government is investing billions of dollars into ensuring low emissions and renewable energy is 
                            incorporated in many areas of life, such as the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative, focused on low 
                            emissions technologies, and the $3 billion Energy Efficient Homes Package, which provides Australian 
                            homes money to incorporate efficient insulation, and offers incentives to installing solar systems. This
                            over time will reduce energy usage and save Australians money on energy bills.
